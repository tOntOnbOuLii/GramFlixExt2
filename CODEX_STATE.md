# Codex Session State

## Actions performed
- Audited repository structure and documentation.
- Added asset-backed `providers.json` and `rules.json` for offline defaults.
- Implemented remote config loading with GitHub fallback (providers, hosters, rules).
- Registered `ConfigDrivenProvider` with heuristic scraping support.
- Updated web panel (hosters/providers/rules) to sync with GitHub and avoid domain mentions.
- Added Gradle wrapper, CI workflows (build/release), and GitHub Actions integration.
- Iteratively tuned CI (SDK installs, LF endings, wrapper jar, toolchains) up to the v0.2.1 tag series.
- Upgraded toolchain to AGP 8.7.3 / Kotlin 2.1.0 / Gradle 8.9 with JDK 17.
- Reworked `ConfigDrivenProvider` to Kotlin 2.1 APIs and extractor helpers.
- Annotated the plugin entry-point with `@CloudstreamPlugin`, verified `:app:make` packaging, and aligned Cloudstream dependencies on the `pre-release` channel.
- Patched `gradlew.bat` to honor `JAVA_HOME` on Windows and published release `v1.0.0` (workflow now ships `gramflix-all.cs3`).

## Outstanding issues
- Remaining nullable warnings in config helpers (`optString`) should be cleaned up before tightening compiler flags.

## Next intended steps
- Confirm any externally hosted `repo.json` points to `releases/latest` (now serving `v1.0.0` with `gramflix-all.cs3`).
- Address the outstanding null-safety warnings so stricter builds can be enabled.
